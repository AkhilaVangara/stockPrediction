# stockPrediction
A first step in a multi step design for a stock prediction app. Through the usage of LSTM networks, an attempt is made to predict stock prices of IBM. Project is still underway - an introduction to the thesis subject for Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning for trading.

## Current Issues:
The algorithm used it LSTM, and on close inspection it seems to only predict the average value. This will be corrected in the next few weeks through a combination of feature engineering for time series and the use of News articles and sentiment analysis for a given stock. In addition, there will also be an attempt to use traditional methods such as kalman filters for time series.
